			<h2>Run Midica</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Install Java</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Midica is written in Java, so you need to have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your Computer to use Midica.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use any JRE of version 1.7 or later. Probably you already have Java installed. If not, you can download it from somewhere
				in the internet, e.g. from <a href="https://www.java.com/download/">java.com</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Download Midica</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				You can download Midica from the <a href="https://github.com/truj/midica">Github Repository</a>.
				Just download the latest jar file that is named something like <code>midica-VERSION.jar</code>
				(where <code>VERSION</code> is the latest version number).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Start Midica</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				If Java is installed and Midica is downloaded you can start it on the command line with the following command:
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>java -jar midica-VERSION.jar</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				Depending on your operating system, there is a chance that you can start the .jar file with a doubleclick.
				Then you don't need the command line.

			<h2>Sound</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Before you start playing Music, you should load a soundfont. Otherwise Midica uses the Java default soundfont which is very bad.
				It calls itself "Emergency GM sound set" and this name makes sense. It produces the worst sound in the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the beginning I would suggest to use the FluidR3_GM Soundfont.
				You can download it e.g. from the <a href="http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/f/fluid-soundfont/">Debian server</a>.
				Download the <code>.tar.gz</code> file and unpack it. Then you find the file <code>FluidR3_GM.sf2</code>. This is the file you need.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have this or any other soundfont file on your computer, start Midica like described above.
				The main window of Midica opens. In the import area under "Soundfont" click the button "select file".
				Then choose the soundfont file with the extension <code>.sf2</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Check the "Remember" checkbox next to the Button. Then Midica remembers the soundfont file path. If you close Midica
				and then start it again, the soundfont will be loaded automatically.
			</p>

			<h2>Development Process</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				In order to develop a MIDI sequence in MidicaPL you must write the source code into a plain text file with the
				file extension <code>.midica</code>. It doesn't matter which editor you use. Just use your favorite text editor.
			</p>
			<p>
				MidicaPL stands for "Midica Programming Language". The actual MidicaPL syntax and note naming depends on
				the chosen configuration. In this tutorial the configuration settings shown in the
				<span class="reference">Configuration</span> table are assumed.
				This is the default configuration.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the process you will switch from your editor to the Midica player very often.
				You will change the file and save it in the editor, then switch to the player and hit the "Reparse" button or press F5.
				Then the file will be parsed again. When hitting the "Play" button or pressing "p", the resulting MIDI sequence will be played.
			</p>

			<p>
				First of all you have to create the file. Just create an empty file and call it <code>tutorial.midica</code>
				or something else with the file extension <code>.midica</code>.
				Then start Midica, if not yet done. In the main window, press the upper right button. It's the "select file"
				button in the import area to choose a MidicaPL file. Choose the empty file that you just created.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now you can open the player with the button "Start Player".
				You cannot play anything yet because the file is still empty and so the MIDI sequence is empty as well.
				But now you can start your development cycle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Begin with <a href="tutorial-1.html">chapter 1</a> of the tutorial. Follow the instructions and change the source file
				according to the examples. Then switch to the player and press "Reparse" or F5, then play the sequence.
				Then change the file again. Try out your own variations of the examples and so on...
			</p>
			<p>
				Developing with Midica is a bit like developing a website. But the HTML editor is any text editor. And the browser is the player.
				But F5 works similarly.
