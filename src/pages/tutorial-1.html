				This is the first chapter of the MidicaPL tutorial, teaching the basics of the language.
				If you did not yet follow the <a href="tutorial.html">preparation instructions</a>, please do so before you continue reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of this chapter you will be able to create melodies with notes, chords and rests
				using different instruments playing together. Moreover you will learn how to change the tempo of your music.

			<h2>Whitespaces and Comments</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Each line of the source code can either be empty or contains a command or a comment or both.
				Comments are prefixed by the symbol <code>//</code> and end at the end of the line.
				Empty lines and comments are ignored. Whitespaces at the beginning or end of a line are also ignored.
				More than one whitespace has the same effect as one single whitespace.

			<h2>Instrument Definition Block</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Before you can play any sounds, you must define the instruments to be used by each channel.
				Every channel that will be used later must be initialized inside of a block beginning with
				<code>INSTRUMENTS</code> and ending with <code>END</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only exception is the percussion channel (channel <em>9</em>) which may (but does not need to) be defined explicitly.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.instruments }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				Each line inside of this block contains 3 columns, separated by one or more whitespaces.
				The last column may also contain more whitespaces. These are not interpreted as separator but as a part of the content.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{!-- ensure a line break --}}</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>1st column</h3>
			<p>
				The first column contains the chanel number. Valid values are the numbers <code>0</code> - <code>15</code> and the symbol <code>p</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>p</code> is just an alias for <code>9</code> which is the percussion channel number.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>2nd column</h3>
			<p>
				The second column describes the instrument. It may contain a valid <em>instrument ID</em> or <em>drumkit ID</em> or the accoring <em>MIDI program number</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Valid instrument or drumkit IDs can be found in the <em>info window</em> under <a href="/screenshots.html#info-config">Configuration</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>3rd column</h3>
			<p>
				The third column contains a description of the instrument. This will be displayed as a channel comment in the player.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In the above example we use an <em>instrument ID</em> for the channels <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>, a <em>MIDI program number</em> for
				channel <em>2</em>, and a <em>drumkit ID</em> for channel <em>9</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The line defining the percussion channel (<em>p</em>) is optional. If it is omitted, the standard drumkit
				(MIDI program number <em>0</em>) is used.
			</p>
		</div>

	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="channel-commands">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Channel commands</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				After you have defined some channel instruments, you can use <em>channel commands</em> in order to play music.
				The most important things to do with channel commands is playing notes, chords or rests.
			</p>
			<p>
				Channel commands consist of at least 3 columns, separated by whitespaces:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Channel column</li>
				<li>Note column</li>
				<li>Length column</li>
				<li>
					(Optional) After the 3rd column one or more options may follow. Details will be described in chapter 2. Please be patient.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The following example shows the first notes of "Happy birthday to you" on channel <em>0</em>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.happy-birthday }}</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>Channel column</h3>
			<p>
				This column contains the chanel number. Valid values are the numbers <code>0</code> - <code>15</code> and the symbol <code>p</code>.
				Again, <code>p</code> is an alias for <code>9</code> (percussion channel).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>Note column</h3>
			<p>
				This column can contain a <em>note name</em>, a <em>percussion ID</em>, a <em>chord name</em> or the symbol <code>-</code> which
				stands for a rest (pause). Additionally you can also use the <em>MIDI note number</em>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>Length column</h3>
			<p>
				This column contians a length definition. A <em>full</em>, a <em>half</em>, a <em>quarter</em>, an <em>eighth</em> note and so on is defined like
				<code>/1</code>, <code>/2</code>, <code>/4</code>, <code>/8</code>
				and so on. For dotted notes a <code>.</code> is added (but without any whitespace between).
				More details about length definitions will follow in chapter 2.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The following example shows another version of "Happy birthday to you" but with a rest instead of "day", so that it's actually only
				"Happy birth... to you".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.happy-birthday-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first eighth note is now dotted, so that the length is 1.5 times longer. Therefore the second note is only a 16th.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pitch of the first two notes is equivalent. Both are a middle C.
				But in the first line the <em>note name</em> <code>c</code> is used, and in the second
				line the <em>MIDI note number</em> <code>60</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Note Names</h3>
			<p>
				Which note names are valid, depends on the configured <em>note system</em>, <em>half tone symbol</em> and <em>octave naming</em>.
				In the standard configuration, lower-cased international note names are used, and the half tone symbol is a sharp: <code>#</code>.
				Then follows an octave modifier.
			</p>
			<p>
				The octave beginning with the middle C is not modified.
			</p>
			<p>
				Higher octaves are modified with <code>+</code>, <code>+2</code>, <code>+3</code> and so on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lower octaves are modified with <code>-</code>, <code>-2</code>, <code>-3</code> and so on.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the first bar of "Through the Never" by "Metallica", played in channel 1.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.through-the-never }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Using multiple channels</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Different channels can play notes at the same time.
				Each channel command appends a note (or something else) to the end of a channel.
				So the order of channel commands for the same channel is important.
				But the order of commands for different channels does not matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following examples are equivalent. They play the first two bars of "Jingle Bells".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.jingle-bells }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first example adds all notes to channel 0 before adding all notes to channel 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second example executes the commands for channel 1 first, and then for channel 0.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third example works more or less in the order of appearance of the notes in time.
				Of cause this is not always possible because some notes are played simultaniously but
				two channel commands cannot be written into the same line of source code.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="chords">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Chords</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A chord in MidicaPL is an amount of notes to be played at the same time in the same channel, with the same length and velocity.
				There are 2 types of chords: <em>inline</em> chords and <em>predefined</em> chords.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Inline Chords</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				An inline chord is a number of note names in the second column of a channel command, separated by a <code>,</code>.
				There are no whitespaces allowed between the notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the beginning of Bob Marley's song "No Woman No Cry".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.chords }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The piano is played in channel 1 using inline chords.
				The singer's voice is played in Channel 0 without chords.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Predefined Chords</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A predefined chord must be defined before it can be used. A chord definition consists of 3 or more columns, separated by whitespaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first column is the keyword <code>CHORD</code>.
				The second column is a self-given chord name.
				The other column(s) contain the notes belonging to that chord, one note by column.
				The notes can be separated either by <code>,</code> symbols or whitespaces or both.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later the chords can be used like normal notes inside of a channel command. But instead of the note name, the self-given chord name is used.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the same notes again but this time with predefined chords instead of inline chords.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.chords-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Imagine you use the same chord (e.g. C-major) many times in a song. And then you want to modify the chord (e.g. transform it into C-maj-7).
				With predefined chords you only need to change the chord definition while with inline chords you need to change every appearance.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="global-commands">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Global Commands</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				While channel commands only affect one channel, there are also global commands that affect more than one channel.
				Most of them even affect all channels. A global command begins with the symbol <code>*</code> in it's first column.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Synchronize</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Every global command syncronizes all (or at least some) channels. That means the current channel lengths are made equal to
				the furthest channel's length.
				A global command adds an according amount of rests to all other channels.
				So many that all synchronized channels have the same length as the furthest channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				This behaviour can be very helpful. So even a global command without any further options can be useful.
				This empty form of a global command is called <em>synchronize</em> command because it's only purpose is to synchronize all channels.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the first 2 bars of "The Black Perl" by "Klaus Badelt" from the film
				"Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Perl".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.the-black-perl }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Channel 1 contains a lot of rests but none of them is written with a channel command.
				The rests are added implicitely by adding a synchronize command at the end of each bar.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Partial Synchronize</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				If you want to synchronize only a part of the channels, you can use a partial synchronize command.
				This is the only global command that does not synchronize all channels but only some of them.
				In the second column of a partial synchronzie there is a description which channels should be synchronized.
			</p>
			<p>
				This description can be a comma-separated list of channel numbers (e.g. <code>1,2,3</code>) or a range
				like <code>1-3</code>) or a mix like <code>1-3,5,6-8,11</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use the symbol <code>p</code> for channel 9 here as well.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.partial-sync }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				This example synchronizes channels 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13 and 14 with each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				The partial synchronize is the only global command that synchronizes only a part of the channels.
				All other types of global commands always synchronize all channels.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Set Tempo</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Another important global command is a tempo change. The tempo is defined in "beats per minute" (BPM).
				The second column of the global command contains the symbol <code>tempo</code> and the third column the desired value.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value is the number of quarter notes that is played in one minute.
				The default value is 120. It could be changed to 150 using the following command:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-tempo }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Like every other global command, a tempo change synchronizes all channels.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p class="hint">
				The following global commands ("time signature" and "key signature") are not audible. They only add meta information to the MIDI sequence.
				If you are only interested in hearable commands, you can continue directly with <a href="tutorial-2.html">chapter 2</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Set Time Signature</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The time signature can be set with the <code>time</code> command in the second column. The third column contains
				the desired time definition.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time definition contains a <i>nominator</i> (number) and a <i>denominator</i>, separated by a <code>/</code>.
				<br />
				The MIDI default is a <em>4/4</em> beat.
				<br />
				A <em>3/4</em> beat would be defined like this:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-time }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The denominator must be a number that can be described as 2<sup>n</sup>. That means valid denominators are <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>,
				<em>4</em>, <em>8</em>, <em>16</em>, <em>32</em>, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				The time signature does not change the sound of the MIDI sequence at all. However it can make sence to define it anyway.
				It can be a useful hint for third-party software processing the MIDI file exported by Midica.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Set Key Signature</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The key signature can be set with the <code>key</code> command in the second column. The third column contains the desired key definition.
			</p>
			<p>
				The key definition contains a valid note name and a tonality, separated by a <code>/</code>.
				<br />
				The tonality can be <code>maj</code> for <em>major</em> or <code>min</code> for <em>minor</em>.
				<br />
				The MIDI default is <em>C major</em>, which could also be defined explicitely by the following command:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-key }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				What a <i>valid note name</i> is, depends on the configured Note System, Half Tone Symbol and Octave Naming.
				In the standard configuration a <em>C# minor</em> could be set with one of the following commands.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-key-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Of cause these commands are equal because the octave is irrelevant for the key signature.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like the time signature, the key signature does not change the sound at all. But it can also be useful for
				another software processing the produced MIDI sequence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Internally the key signature is translated into a number of <i>sharps</i> or <i>flats</i> and a flag for major or minor.
				MIDI allows a maximum of 7 sharps or flats. So in some cases the key signature is converted automatically to something corresponding.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example a <em>D# major</em> would have 9 sharps which is more than the allowed 7. So it's converted to the corresponding
				<em>Eb major</em> with 3 flats instead.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other key signatures can be expressed either with an allowed number of sharps or an(other) allowed number of flats.
				For example <em>F# major</em> with 6 sharps corresponds to <em>Gb major</em> with 6 flats.
				Or <em>G# minor</em> with 5 sharps corresponds to <em>Ab minor</em> with 7 flats.
				In these cases the configured half tone symbol is used to determine which key signature is used. The one with sharps or the one
				with flats.
				This ensures that the key signature in the MIDI sequence is as close as possible to the source code, and it's only converted
				if there is no other legal way.
