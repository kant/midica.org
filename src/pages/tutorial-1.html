			<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				MidicaPL stands for "Midica Programming Language". It is the language used to program MIDI sequences.
				The MidicaPL source code has to be written into plain text files with the file extension ".midica".
			</p>
			<p>
				The actual MidicaPL syntax and note naming depends on the chosen configuration. In this tutorial the
				configuration settings shown in the <span class="reference">Configuration</span> table are assumed.
				This is the default configuration.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you don't use the default configuration, you can consult the
				<a href="/#info-config">Configuration Tab of the Info Window</a> in order to find out the actual
				note naming and syntax elements.

			<h2>Code Layout and Comments</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Each line of the source code can either be empty or contains a command or a comment or both.
				Comments are prefixed by the symbol <code>//</code> and end at the end of the line.
				Empty lines and comments are ignored. Whitespaces at the beginning or end of a line are also ignored.
				More than one whitespace has the same effect as one single whitespace.
			</p>
			<p>
				So the next two source code examples are equivalent.

			<h2>Instrument Definition Block</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first thing to be defined inside of a source file must be the instruments that each channel uses.
				Each channel that will be used later must be initialized inside of a block beginning with
				<code>INSTRUMENTS</code> and ending with <code>END</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The only exception is the percussion channel (channel <em>9</em>) which may (but does not need to) be defined explicitely.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.instruments }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				Each line inside this block contains 3 columns, separated by one or more whitespaces.
				The last column may also contain more whitespaces. These are not interpreted as separator but as a part of the content.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{!-- ensure a line break --}}</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>1st column</h3>
			<p>
				The first column contains the chanel number. Valid values are the numbers <code>0</code> - <code>15</code> and the symbol <code>p</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>p</code> is just an alias for <code>9</code> which is the percussion channel number.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>2nd column</h3>
			<p>
				The second column describes the instrument. It may contain a valid <em>instrument shortcut</em> or a <em>MIDI program number</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Valid instrument shortcuts can be found in the <em>info window</em> under  <a href="/#info-config">Configuration / Instrument Shortcuts</a>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>3rd column</h3>
			<p>
				The third column contains a description of the instrument. This will be displayed as a channel comment in the player.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In the above example we use an <em>instrument shortcut</em> for the channels <em>0</em> and <em>1</em> and a <em>MIDI program number</em> for the
				channels <em>2</em> and <em>9</em>. The line defining the percussion channel (<em>p</em>) is optional. If it is omitted, the standard drumkit
				(MIDI program number <em>0</em>) is used.
			</p>
		</div>

	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="channel-commands">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Channel commands</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				After you have defined some channel instruments, you can use <em>channel commands</em> in order to play music.
				The most important things to do with channel commands is playing notes, chords or rests.
			</p>
			<p>
				Channel commands consist of at least 3 columns, separated by whitespaces:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Channel column</li>
				<li>Note column</li>
				<li>Length column</li>
				<li>
					(Optional) After the 3rd column one or more options may follow. Details will be described in chapter 2. Please be patient.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The following example shows the first notes of "Happy birthday to you" on channel <em>0</em>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.happy-birthday }}</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>Channel column</h3>
			<p>
				This column contains the chanel number. Valid values are the numbers <code>0</code> - <code>15</code> and the symbol <code>p</code>.
				Again, <code>p</code> is an alias for <code>9</code> (percussion channel).
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>Note column</h3>
			<p>
				This column can contain a <em>note name</em>, a <em>percussion shortcut</em>, a <em>chord name</em> or the symbol <code>-</code> which
				stands for a rest (pause). Additionally you can also use the <em>MIDI note number</em>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell large-4">
			<h3>Length column</h3>
			<p>
				This column contians a length definition. A <em>full</em>, a <em>half</em>, a <em>quarter</em>, an <em>eighth</em> note and so on is defined like
				<code>/1</code>, <code>/2</code>, <code>/4</code>, <code>/8</code>
				and so on. For dotted notes a <code>.</code> is added (but without any whitespace between).
				More details about length definitions will follow in chapter 2.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The following example shows another version of "Happy birthday to you" but with a rest instead of "day", so that it's actually only
				"Happy birth... to you".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.happy-birthday-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first eighth note is now dotted, so that the length is 1.5 times longer. Therefore the second note is only a 16th.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pitch of the first two notes is equivalent. Both are a middle C.
				But in the first line the <em>note name</em> <code>c</code> is used, and in the second
				line the <em>MIDI note number</em> <code>60</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Note Names</h3>
			<p>
				Which note names are valid, depends on the configured <em>note system</em>, <em>half tone symbol</em> and <em>octave naming</em>.
				In the standard configuration, lower-cased international note names are used, and the half tone symbol is a sharp: <code>#</code>.
				Then follows an octave modifier.
			</p>
				The octave beginning with the middle C is not modified. Higher octaves are modified with one <code>+</code> per octave. For lower octaves,
				<code>-</code> symbols are use.
			<p>
				The following example shows the first bar of "Through the Never" by "Metallica", played in channel 1.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.through-the-never }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Using multiple channels</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Different channels can play notes at the same time.
				Each channel command appends a note (or something else) to the end of a channel.
				So the order of channel commands for the same channel is important.
				But the order of commands for different channels does not matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following examples are equivalent. They play the first two bars of "Jingle Bells".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.jingle-bells }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first example adds all notes to channel 0 before adding all notes to channel 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second example executes the commands for channel 1 first, and then for channel 0.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third example works more or less in the order of appearance of the notes in time.
				Of cause this is not always possible because some notes are played simultaniously but
				two channel commands cannot be written into the same line of source code.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="chords">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Chords</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A chord in MidicaPL is an amount of notes to be played at the same time in the same channel, with the same length and velocity.
				There are 2 types of chords: <em>inline</em> chords and <em>predefined</em> chords. Here we focus on Inline Chords.
				The predefined chords will be described in chapter 2.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Inline Chords</h3>
			<p>
				An inline chord is a number of note names in the second column of a channel command, separated by a <code>,</code>.
				There are no whitespaces allowed between the notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the beginning of Bob Marley's song "No Woman No Cry".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.chords }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The piano is played in channel 1 using inline chords.
				The singer's voice is played in Channel 0 without chords.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="global-commands">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Global Commands</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				While channel commands only affect one channel, there are also global commands that affect all channels.
				A global command begins with the symbol <code>*</code> in it's first column.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Synchronize</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Every global command syncronizes all channels. That means the current channel lengths are made equal to
				the furthest channel's length.
				A global command adds an according amount of rests to all other channels.
				So many that all channels have the same length as the furthest channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				This behaviour can be very helpful. So even a global command without any further options can be useful.
				This empty form of a global command is called <em>synchronize</em> command because it's only purpose is to synchronize the channels.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows the first 2 bars of "The Black Perl" by "Klaus Badelt" from the film
				"Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Perl".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.the-black-perl }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Channel 1 contains a lot of rests but none of them is written with a channel command.
				The rests are added implicitely by adding a synchronize command at the end of each bar.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Set Tempo</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Another important global command is a tempo change. The tempo is defined in "beats per minute" (BPM).
				The second column of the global command contains the symbol <code>bpm</code> and the third column the desired value.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value is the number of quarter notes that is played in one minute.
				The default value is 120. It could be changed to 150 using the following command:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.set-tempo }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Like every other global command, a tempo change synchronizes all channels.
			</p>
