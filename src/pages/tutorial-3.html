			<p>
				This is the third chapter of the MidicaPL tutorial. Please read <a href="tutorial-1.html">chapter 1</a> and
				<a href="tutorial-2.html">chapter 2</a> first, if you have not yet done that already.
			</p>
			<p>
				So far you learned a lot about lowlevel commands. In this chapter we will focus on highlevel structures that help to reuse your code,
				like macros, blocks and loops.
			</p>

			<h2>Macros</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Most programming languages have functions, methods or another kind of subroutines that can be called from different places
				inside of your source code. In MidicaPL such functions are called <em>macro</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A macro is a bock beginning with the keyword <code>MACRO</code>, followed by one or more whitespaces and a self-given macro name.
				The block is closed with the keyword <code>END</code>.
				Inside the block you can write as many channel commands or global commans as you want.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example defines two macros for "Another one bites the dust" by "Queen".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-drum-bass }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				First we introduce the bass instrument in channel 5 so that we can use it later. Then we define the macros.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first macro is called <code>bassline</code>. It defines the main bassline and has a length of 8 quarter notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second macro is called <code>drums</code>. It defines the drum beat with a length of 2 quarter notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				So far no sound is produced at all. The macros have been defined but they have not yet been called.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later we want to play the bass and the drums together. The <code>bassline</code> macro is 4 times longer
				than the <code>drums</code> macro.
				That means we need to call <code>drums</code> 4 times more often than <code>bassline</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A macro can be called with the <code>INCLUDE</code> command, followed by one or more whitespaces and the macro name.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can imagine that an <code>INCLUDE</code> command is internally replaced by the code inside of the macro.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example plays the macros that we have defined before. The first source code version uses <code>INCLUDE</code> commands.
				The second version shows how these INCLUDEs would look like if they were replaced by the according macro contents.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Both macros play in different channels. So if we include them after each other they play simultaneously.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A macro can also be called from another macro.
				So an alternative for the last example would be the usage of a further macro:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				Now we need to handle the different lengths of tha bass and drum macros only at one place: inside the macro <code>drum-and-bass</code>.
				Later we can call this macro as often as we want.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In the last example we defined the macro first and included it later. But the other way round is also possible.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-3 }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				In this example the macro is included before it is defined.

			<h2>Include Options</h2>

		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				Do you remember the <a href="tutorial-2.html#channel-options">channel command options</a> from chapter 2?
			</p>
			<p>
				An <code>INCLUDE</code> command can also have options.
				As you can see in the <em>Include Options</em> table, <code>quantity</code> (short version: <code>q</code>) and
				<code>multiple</code> (short version: <code>m</code>) are also allowed as include options.
			</p>

		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<table>

					Include Options

					<tr>
						<th>Long Name</th>
						<th>Short Name</th>

			<p>
				Include options are attached to the end of the <code>INCLUDE</code> command line, separated from the macro name by one or more whitespaces.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Quantity (Include Option)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Probably you already have guessed what the <code>quantity</code> option does: It repeats the called macro as often as the option value.
				So we can rewrite our includes using the quantity option. The following versions are all equivalent:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-q }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Multiple (Include Option)</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The <code>multiple</code> option can be used to implement different voices playing in the same channel in the same time.
				It plays the macro and then moves the end markers of each involved channel to the position they had before calling the macro.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other words: After playing a macro with this option, the next notes in the same channels are played in the same time as the macro.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next example shows how we can use this option in order to play a small variation.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-complete }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The red part is the anacrusis (upbeat) without drums. The sync command (<code>*</code>) synchronizes
				the involved channels so that the drums start after the anacrusis.
			</p>
			<p>
				The blue part adds two bass notes to the end of the second measure. Therefore the first <code>INCLUDE</code> command
				is marked as <code>multiple</code> so that the following code is added to the time where the include started.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we want to add something to the last eighth of the measure, we need to fill up the beginning with rests in the bass channel.
				We need a whole rest with three dots.
			</p>
			<p>
				After adding the rest and the notes, our bass channel is two beats further than our drums channel. So we need to synchronize them
				again with another <code>*</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then we are ready to include <code>drum-and-bass</code> again a few times.

			<h2>Nestable Blocks</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Macros are useful to group a number of commands and apply them later using a self-invented name.
				But sometimes you may want to group commands without inventing a name and execute them directly instead of calling them later.
				That's where nestable blocks are used.
			</p>
			<p>
				Programming languages also have nestable blocks like <em>if</em> or <em>else</em> blocks or loops.
				In MidicaPL such a block is opened by a line beginning with <code>(</code> and closed by a line beginning with <code>)</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				So let's try to rewrite the drums and bass of the above song using nestable blocks:
