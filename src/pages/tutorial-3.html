			<p>
				This is the third chapter of the MidicaPL tutorial. Please read <a href="tutorial-1.html">chapter 1</a> and
				<a href="tutorial-2.html">chapter 2</a> first, if you have not yet done that already.
			</p>
			<p>
				So far you learned a lot about lowlevel commands. In this chapter we will focus on highlevel structures that help to reuse your code,
				like macros, blocks and loops.
			</p>

			<h2>Macros</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Most programming languages have functions, methods or another kind of subroutines that can be called from different places
				inside of your source code. In MidicaPL such functions are called <em>macro</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A macro is a bock beginning with the keyword <code>MACRO</code>, followed by one or more whitespaces and a self-given macro name.
				The block is closed with the keyword <code>END</code>.
				Inside the block you can write as many channel commands or global commans as you want.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example defines two macros for "Another one bites the dust" by "Queen".
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-drum-bass }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				First we introduce the bass instrument in channel 5 so that we can use it later. Then we define the macros.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first macro is called <code>bassline</code>. It defines the main bassline and has a length of 8 quarter notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second macro is called <code>drums</code>. It defines the drum beat with a length of 2 quarter notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				So far no sound is produced at all. The macros have been defined but they have not yet been called.
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to play the bass and the drums together. The <code>bassline</code> macro is 4 times longer
				than the <code>drums</code> macro.
				That means we need to call <code>drums</code> 4 times more often than <code>bassline</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A macro can be called with the <code>INCLUDE</code> command, followed by one or more whitespaces and the macro name.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example plays the macros that we have defined before.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				A macro can also be called from another macro.
				So an alternative for the last example would be the usage of a further macro:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.another-one-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				Now we need to handle the different lengths of tha bass and drum macros only at one place: inside the macro <code>drum-and-bass</code>.
				Later we can call this macro as often as we want.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Include Options</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<p>
				Do you remember the <a href="tutorial-2.html#channel-options">channel command options</a> from chapter 2?
			</p>
			<p>
				An <code>INCLUDE</code> command can also have options.
				As you can see in the <em>Include Options</em> table, <code>quantity</code> (short version: <code>q</code>) and
				<code>multiple</code> (short version: <code>m</code>) are also allowed as include options.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-6">
			<table>
				<caption>
					Include Options
				</caption>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Long Name</th>
						<th>Short Name</th>
						<th>Type</th>
						<th>Min Value</th>
						<th>Max Value</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>quantity</td>
						<td>q</td>
						<td>integer</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>&infin;</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>multiple</td>
						<td>m</td>
						<td>none</td>
						<td>-</td>
						<td>-</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Include options are attached to the end of the <code>INCLUDE</code> command line, separated from the macro name by one or more whitespaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				Probably you already have guessed what the <code>quantity</code> option does: It repeats the called macro as often as the option value.
				So we can rewrite the last example with the quantity option. The following versions are all equivalent:
