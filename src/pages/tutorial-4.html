			<h2>Meta Information</h2>

			<p>
				A MIDI sequence can contain meta information that does not have any effect to the produced sound.
				In MidicaPL a part of this meta information is implemented with global commands, as you have already
				learned in chapter <a href="tutorial-1.html">1</a>. This applies to meta information like
				<em>key signature</em> or <em>time signature</em> that can occur more than once at different time
				spots within the sequence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other parts of meta information refer to the whole sequence. These parts are included in a
				META block, beginning with the keyword <code>META</code> and ending with <code>END</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Inside a META block you can use any field from the <em>meta fields</em> table. Each line must begin
				with a field name, followed by whitespaces and a value.

			<h2>Constants</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				In chapter <a href="tutorial-3.html">3</a> you learned how to re-use an arbitrary number of commmands by using macros.
				But sometimes you may want to re-use very small parts of code &dash; even smaller than a whole command.
				In this case constants can get useful.
			</p>
			<p>
				A constant must be defined with the <code>CONST</code> command. This command consists of the following parts:
				<ul>
					<li><code>CONST</code> (the constant definition command)</li>
					<li>The constant name, beginning with a <code>$</code> symbol</li>
					<li>An optional <code>=</code> symbol. (If ommitted, whitespaces must be used instead. Otherwise whitespaces <em>may</em> be used anyway.)</li>
					<li>The value of the constant.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The constant name must begin with a <code>$</code> but apart from that it must only contain alphanumeric characters or underscores.
			</p>
			<p>
				The value of a constant can be any part of another command, or even a whole command line.
				In order to use it, you just write the constant name to the right place.
				The following three examples are equivalent:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.const }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first example first defines the constants and then uses them.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second example shows like the same source would look like, if no constants were used.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third example first uses the constants and defines them later. This is possible because the Midica parser interprets
				constant definitions before channel or global commands.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Constants themselves can also consist of other constants. In this case the inner constant must be defined before the outer constant.
				The following two examples are equivalent.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.const-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first example first defines the simple constants <code>$forte</code> (a velocity option) and <code>$drum</code>
				(two percussion instruments: a basedrum and an open triangle).
			</p>
			<p>
				Then it defines <code>$drumroll</code> which contains the percussion instruments from <code>$drum</code>,
				a note length and a tremolo option.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>$play_dr</code> combines the constants from above to a channel command, to be played in channel 9.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last line finally executes this combined channel command.
			</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="define">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>Redefinitions</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The commands and other syntax symbols can be configured to be lower-, mixed- or upper-cased.
				But maybe you are completely unhappy with the used keywords and symbols.
				In this case you can redefine a syntax element with the <code>DEFINE</code> command.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each syntax element has an ID which can be found in the <em>Syntax</em> table.
				You can see the table after clicking <a href="screenshots.html#info-config">Info &amp; Configuration Details > Configuration > Syntax</a>.
				Or in <a data-open="screenshot-syntax-ids">this Screenshot</a>.
			</p>
			<div class="reveal large" id="screenshot-syntax-ids" data-reveal>
				<div>
					<button class="close-button" data-close aria-label="Close" type="button">
						<span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
					</button>
					<br />
				</div>
				<div>
					<img src="assets/img/info_conf_syntax.png" />
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				The <code>DEFINE</code> command needs the ID of the syntax element to be redefined as the first parameter.
				The new value must be provided as the second parameter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following three examples are equivalent. The first and the last one redefine the symbols for anonymous blocks
				to be <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> instead of <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.define }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				As you can see in the third example, redefinitions can be written after using them.
				This is possible because Midica parses <code>DEFINE</code> commands before everything else.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>DEFINE</code> command itself can also be redefined. In this case the order of redefinition commands is important,
				as the following example demonstrates:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">{{> src-example src-examples.define-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell medium-auto">
			<p>
				The <code>DEFINE</code> command is redefined to <code>def</code>. From this moment on, the new version <code>def</code> can be used
				for further redefinitions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this example we redefine the commands <code>MACRO</code>, <code>INSTRUMENTS</code> and <code>END</code> to look
				more like a language derived from C.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of cause the new keyword <code>function{</code> must not contain a whitespace. The same applies for <code>instr{</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				With these changes, we also need to rewrite the <code>INSTRUMENTS</code> block. This is necessary because the old commands
				<code>INSTRUMENTS</code> and <code>END</code> don't work any more.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<h3>Limits of Redefinitions</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Some redefinitions do not work together. For example the end of a definition block must have a different symbol than the end
				of an anonymous block. So you cannot change <code>)</code> and <code>END</code> both to become <code>}</code> at the same time.
				There are more syntax elements that may not have the same keyword while for others it's ok. Some elements even have the same keyword by default.
				It's not possible to list all possibilities here. Just be careful with redefinitions and try to avoid conflicts. Or just try out if it works.
			</p>
			<p>
				You also have to make sure that your redefinitions don't conflict with other elements like note names or percussion instruments.
				For example if you redefine the comment symbol to become <code>#</code> instead of <code>//</code>, you must configure your
				<a data-open="screenshot-halftone">Half Tone Symbol</a> accordingly.
				The default half tone symbol can contain a <code>#</code> inside of a note name. So this combination won't work.
				<div class="reveal large" id="screenshot-halftone" data-reveal>
					<div>
						<button class="close-button" data-close aria-label="Close" type="button">
							<span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
						</button>
						<br />
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="assets/img/config_3_halftone.png" />
					</div>
				</div>
			</p>
			<p>
				The following three syntax elements can still be used in their original form after being redefined:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell medium-shrink">
			<ul>
				<li><code>COMMENT</code></li>
				<li><code>DEFINE</code></li>
				<li><code>INCLUDE_FILE</code></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="cell auto">
			That means you cannot redefine another command to become one of these three keywords. It also means that after redefining one of these
			three commands, you may use either the old keyword or the new one. The following example demonstrates this:
		</div>
		<div class="cell"></div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.define-3 }}</div>
	</section>
	<section class="grid-x grid-padding-x" id="include-file">
		<div class="cell">
			<h2>File Includes</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				Program languages allow to re-use code from other files - modules or libraries. The same is possible in MidicaPL.
				In order to include a file, you need the <code>INCLUDE_FILE</code> command. The only parameter is the path to the included file.
				The file path can be absolute or relative to the including file.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imagine, you are programming music for a latino band and in their repertoire they have music like Salsa, Bachata, Merengue and so on.
				Then you could create one include file for each type of song. The following example shows a possible include file for Salsa songs.
				The first example is the include file, and the second file includes and uses the first file.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.include-file }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first file includes a soundfile that's specialized for Latin music (or maybe even more specialized on Salsa).
				Then follows the <code>INSTRUMENTS</code> block that can be quite large in a Salsa band.
				The macro <code>clave</code> defines the clave rhythm that's very typical for Salsa.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second file uses these definitions to create a song.
			</p>
			<p>
				An included file can also be used for syntax redefinitions or to create constants you often use.
				The following example shows two include files for Bachata songs of your latino band:
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cell">{{> src-example src-examples.include-file-2 }}</div>
		<div class="cell">
			<p>
				The first file redefines some syntax elements and creates a view constants.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second file uses these definitions to create the instruments for Bachata as well as the typical bongo rhythm
				that's used in most Bachata songs. As you can see, Juan switches from the piano to the guitar.
				And Alejandro is the now singing because the voice part in Bachata songs is typically a male part.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third file uses the definitions from the first and second file. Note that it only includes the file
				<code>bachata.midica</code> directly but not <code>definitions.midica</code>. However the latter one is included by
				<code>bachata.midica</code> so it can be used in the third file as well.
